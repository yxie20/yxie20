## Oops! 
We all fail from time to time. I think you learn more about someone from how they failed 
rather than how they succeeded. Plus, you may find some of my bloopers entertaining. So, here are 
my major fiascos:

#### Avon Smart Helmet
In 2019, the college freshman was dreaming of starting his own company and make billions one day. 
So he combined his life passion (cycling) with his major (engineering) to create the Fortune 500 
Most Unknown Startup: Avon Smart Helmet. So he brought together a team of 8 hopeful friends from 
Brown and Princeton to make this happen. They even made a nice souped up 
[website](https://avonsmarthelmet.wixsite.com/website) for it! 
They did manage to get Brown to write us a $2000 check, so they can squander it on circuit boards, 
soldering irons, and Raspberry Pis (and a lobster dinner, but don't tell anyone). 
Of course, the kid is still no billionaire today. But maybe one day it will happen.

#### Smart Lower School Chicken Coop
In Spring 2018, the high school senior was getting too bored after he submitted his college 
applications. So he devised a plan to outfit the Lower School Chicken Coop with internet-connected
gadgets like live-stream cameras, thermometers, and remote door openers. He did make it all happen
(it was mostly his more capable roommate). **But the project came with no warranty!** The water tank leaked, and 
the door jammed. Sincere apologies for the poor hen still living there at the Cluckingham Palace. 
We wish them well.

#### Swimming and Lacrosse
He proved to have zero talent for these two sports. Over the course of 3 years (2014-2017), he 
remained in Lane 1 (slowest lane) and consistently did not make the JV roster. As for Lacrosse, 
he never scored a single goal in the two (and a half) seasons that he played.


#### Duckweed Experiments and Biodiesel
Living true to his passion in renewable energy, Yiheng came up with a master plan on installing a 
campus bio-diesel reactor, turning our deep fryer oil into bio-diesel and then pumping them into 
our lawn mowers. Of course, our school's security staff was not a huge fan of putting 50 gallons of 
flammable liquid into a water heater along with a bunch of electrical components and lye. So the 
project got shut down before it got started. But Yiheng is resilient, he then devised a plan to 
harvest the annual duckweed bloom at our local ponds, and turning the it into bio-ethanol. Yum, 
brewing duckweed wine. We do have a few freezer bags full of duckweed, if you'd like to give it a try!


#### Admissions are not my friends
Yiheng moved to the US in 2014 as a 9-th grader. But before then, he was rejected to all but 
one high school. Whew, that was a bit scary. But he had a blast living and studying in rural 
Pennsylvania for 4 years. It always works out.

Again in 2018, Yiheng was rejected from about a dozen universities, including his dream school. 
We conclude that kids nowadays are just too talented. It also turned out Brown was just the right
place for him. So it all worked out in the end again!

You know what? I'm excited to add more to this list as I go out there and embarrass myself again.
