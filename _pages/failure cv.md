## Oops! 
We all fail from time to time. Sometimes it's because we really took a shot, other times its .
I think you learn more about someone from how they failed rather than how they succeeded. 
Plus, you may find some of them entertaining, so here are my major fiascos:

#### Avon Smart Helmet
In 2019, the college freshman was dreaming of starting his own company and make billions one day. 
So he combined his life passion (cycling) with his major (engineering) to create the Fortune 500 
Most Unknown Startup: Avon Smart Helmet. So he brought together a team of 8 hopeful friends from 
Brown and Princeton to make this happen. They even made a nice souped up 
[website](https://avonsmarthelmet.wixsite.com/website) for it! 
They did manage to get Brown to write us a $2000 check so they can squander it on circuit boards, 
soldering irons, and Raspberry Pis (and a lobster dinner, but don't tell anyone). 
Of course, the now senior is still no billionaire today. But one day it will happen.

#### Smart Lower School Chicken Coop
In Spring 2018, the high school senior was getting too bored after he submitted his college 
applications. So he devised a plan to outfit the Lower School Chicken Coop with internet-connected
gadgets like live-stream cameras, thermometers, and remote door openers. He did make it all happen
(mostly his Thai scholar roommate [Sirapop Theeranantachai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stheera/)
made it work, actually). It was even [featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIiHRNy9Loc&feature=youtu.be) 
in an all-school gathering. But the project came with no warranty. The water tank leaked, and 
the door jammed. Sincere apologies for the poor hen still living there at the Cluckingham Palace. 
We wish them well.

#### College Applications
In Spring 2018, Yiheng was rejected from about a dozen universities, including his dream school. 
We conclude that kids nowadays are just too talented. It also turned out Brown was just the right
place for him. So it all worked out in the end, again!


#### Swimming and Lacrosse
He proved to have zero talent for these two sports. Over the course of 3 years (2014-2017), he 
remained in Lane 1 (slowest lane) and consistently did not make the JV roster. As for Lacrosse, 
he never scored a single goal in the two (and a half) seasons that he played. (He was a cross 
country captain, strangely though...)


#### Duckweed Experiments and Biodiesel
Living true to his passion in renewable energy, 


#### High School Applications
2014 was the year when Yiheng moved to the US to study. But before then, he was rejected to all but 
one high school. Whew, that was a bit scary. But he had a blast living and studying in rural 
Pennsylvania for 4 years.


I'm forever grateful for the risks I've taken, and the mistakes I've made.
