I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2022. 
My research interests include 3D computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and renewable energy.

I am a researcher at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/solutions/digital-twin) since June 2020, 
building industry-leading 3D reconstruction solutions. I am also spearheading research projects at 
[Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/), advised by Professor [Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/). 
Previously, I worked with Professor [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) for the past 2.5 years at 
[Human-Centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/), focusing on sample-efficient learning, and human-centered robotics. 
Finally, I am a part-time cloud developer at [Ethos Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), a non-profit funded by AWS, 
using data science to accelerate Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition.
