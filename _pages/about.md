I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), and an incoming PhD candidate in Fall 2023.
My research interests lie the control, modeling, and optimization of sustianable energy systems.

I am a part-time cloud developer at [AWS Ethos Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), a not-for-profit organization, 
developing data-driven solutions to accelerate Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition. 
Previously, I worked with Professor [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) for three years at 
[Human-Centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/) focusing on sample-efficient reinforcement learning. 
At [Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/), I spearheaded the review project: [Neural Fields in Viusal Computing](https://neuralfields.cs.brown.edu/).

Prior, I was a researcher at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/solutions/digital-twin) for two years, 
building industry-leading 3D reconstruction solutions.
