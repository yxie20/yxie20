I am a first-year PhD student at Caltech, advised by [Steven Low](https://ee.caltech.edu/people/slow) 
and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) in the [Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/). 
My research focuses on the modeling and optimization of energy systems. I am currently working on 
building a campus-scale cyber-physical testbed at Caltech, including high-resolution synchrophasors (PMUs) metering and 
controllable DERs. Accompanying the hardware is a suite of software tools for real-time display, analysis, modeling and control 
of energy resources. Our work provides the foudnation for a variety of downstream applications such as 
real-time alert and monitoring, power factor correction, state estimation, topology & parameter estimation, 
carbon emission reporting and reduction, to name a few. 
Please reach out if you are interested in learning more, collaborating with us or joining our efforts.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Brown University, where 
I worked on various topics in robotics, sample-efficient reinforcement learning, and 3D computer vision. 
I have also spent some time in the industry. In 2022, I worked on data-driven solutions to accelerate 
Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition at AWS ETHOS Hub, a 
not-for-profit organization. I was a researcher at Unity Technologies 
for two years, building industry-leading 3D reconstruction pipelines. Prior, I worked in several start-up 
companies applying machine learning to problems in vision and natural languages.
