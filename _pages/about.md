I am an incoming PhD student at Caltech CMS, where I will be advised by [Steven Low](https://ee.caltech.edu/people/slow) and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). My research interests lie in the control, modeling and optimization of sustainable energy systems. I am currently on gap year, working in the energy industry before starting my PhD studies in September 2023.

Previously, I was an undergrad at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I worked with Professor [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) for three years at [Human-Centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/) focusing on sample-efficient reinforcement learning. At [Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/), I spearheaded the review project: [Neural Fields in Viusal Computing](https://neuralfields.cs.brown.edu/).

I have also spent some time in the industry. I am currently developing data-driven solutions to accelerate Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition at [AWS ETHOS Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), a not-for-profit organization. I was a researcher at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/solutions/digital-twin) for two years, building industry-leading 3D reconstruction algorithms. Prior, I worked in two start-up companies applying machine learning to problems in vision and natural languages.
