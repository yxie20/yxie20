I am a first-year PhD student at Caltech, advised by [Steven Low](https://ee.caltech.edu/people/slow) in the 
[Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/). My research focuses on the 
modeling, control and optimization of energy systems. I am currently building a campus-scale cyber-physical 
testbed at Caltech, including synchronized waveform and phasor measurement units and distributed energy resources. 
Our work provides a foundation for a variety of downstream applications such as real-time state estimation, 
topology & parameter estimation, transient event analysis, inverter control, carbon emission tracking and reduction, to name a few. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Brown University, where 
I worked on various topics in robotics, reinforcement learning, and 3D computer vision. 
I have also spent some time in the industry. In 2022, I worked on data-driven solutions to accelerate 
Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition at AWS ETHOS Hub, a not-for-profit organization. 
I was a researcher at Unity Technologies for two years, building industry-leading 3D reconstruction pipelines. 
Prior, I worked in several start-up companies applying machine learning to problems in vision and natural languages.
