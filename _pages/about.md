I am a first-year PhD student at Caltech, advised by [Steven Low](https://ee.caltech.edu/people/slow) 
and [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) in the [Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/). 
My research focuses the modeling and optimization of energy systems.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Brown University, where 
I worked on various topics in robotics, sample-efficient reinforcement learning, and 3D computer vision. 
I have also spent some time in the industry. In 2022, I worked on data-driven solutions to accelerate 
Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition at [AWS ETHOS Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), a 
not-for-profit organization. I was a researcher at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/solutions/digital-twin) 
for two years, building industry-leading 3D reconstruction pipelines. Prior, I worked in several start-up 
companies applying machine learning to problems in vision and natural languages.
