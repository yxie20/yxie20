I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2022. 
My research interests include 3D computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and renewable energy.

I am a researcher at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/solutions/digital-twin) since June 2020, 
building industry-leading 3D reconstruction solutions. I am also spearheading research projects at 
[Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/), advised by Professor [Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/). 
Previously, I worked with Professor [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) for the past 2.5 years at 
[Human-Centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/), focusing on sample-efficient learning, and human-centered robotics. 
Finally, I am a part-time cloud developer at [Ethos Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), a non-profit funded by AWS, 
using data science to accelerate Rhode Island's sustainable energy transition.

Hello Michael, these are the videos Royal sent a while ago. You can find the original message here: https://brownrlab.slack.com/archives/GNG8TP6P5/p1569877922005000

Michael Littman Ok, thanks. I don’t think these videos have much to do with explainable AI, so I’m not inclined to include them. (editado)

Michael Littman Wow. I know you said you were too busy to make this paper happen, but I'm so glad you did it anyway. Fantastic work!
10:21
Yiheng Xie Thank you for pushing us along the way!

Perhaps now is a good time to ask...:lengua_fuera_con_ojos_cerrados: Would you be happy to update your recommendation letter for my PhD applications, now that we know each other a lot better from this project? That'll mean a lot to me! (editado) 
10:25
I'll send over my final list of schools tomorrow, and the links for you to submit the letter. (editado) 
10:26
Regardless, working with you for the past 2.5 years has been a tremendous growth opportunity, so thank you!
12:14
Michael Littman Yes, of course. Working together directly will make the letter a lot stronger.
