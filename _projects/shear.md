**December 2018 - December 2020**

I investigated the mechanical failure properties of 2D nano-materials, advised by Professor 
[Robert Hurt](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rhurt). 
I proposed an entirely novel research methodology, using computer vision algorithm for visualizing and 
analyzing tensile testing and optical spectroscopy data. 
I also conducted wet-lab work, producing graphene and MoS2 thin films.
