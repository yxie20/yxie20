**December 2018 - December 2020**

I investigated the mechanical failure properties of 2D nano-materials, advised by Professor
[Robert Hurt](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rhurt) at Brown
(Institute of Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation)[https://www.brown.edu/research/institute-molecular-nanoscale-innovation/].
I proposed an entirely novel research methodology and developed a computer vision algorithm for analyzing tensile testing data.
I also conducted wet-lab work, producing graphene and MoS2 thin films.
