From October 2020 - August 2021, I researched under the supervision of Professor Michael Littman, 
I researched under the supervision of Professor [Micahel Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) and 
collaborated with graduate student [Mingxuan Li](http://mingxuan.me/) at Brown 
[Human-Centered Robotics Initiative](https://hcri.brown.edu/). 
Our work, *Learning to Control via Object-Oriented Latent Dynamics Graph*, proposed a novel 
vision-based and object-centric world model for RL agents. I proposed an unsupervised segmentation 
and clustering computer vision algorithm for extracting object-oriented game dynamics. We used 
[PySR](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR) (a symbolic regression engine) to replace black-box 
Graph Neural Network components in our world model, so as to achieve with interpretable planning.
