At [Learnable](https://learnable.ai/), I developed the natural language processing algorithm for our [industry-leading 
automatic grading engine](https://learnable.ai/#/solution/automatic-grading-platform). 
Leading a team of 5 engineers, my work focused on parsing messy student handwriting into 
formal machine language. Our product was deployed in April 2020 and recently achieved over 99%
accuracy for the 2021 National College Entrance Examination in China (a.k.a. Gaokao) in several provinces.
