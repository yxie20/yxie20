At [Learnable](https://learnable.ai/), I developed the natural language processing algorithm for our industry-leading 
automatic grading engine. My work focuses on translates student handwriting (noisy) into formal 
machine language for K-12 math problem grading. Our product was deployed and achieved over 99%
accuracy for the 2021 National College Entrance Examination in China (a.k.a. Gaokao) in several provinces.
