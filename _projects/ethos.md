I am a part-time intern at [Ethos Hub](https://www.ethoshub.org/), 
, a non-profit funded by AWS, developing data-driven solutions to accelerate Rhode Islandâ€™s 
sustainable energy transition.

#### Resilience in Extreme Weather Events via Vegetation Management
Working with utility providers in the regions, we are developing data-driven 
solutions to identify ash tree species near power lines, which are the major 
culprit in taking down power lines during extreme weather events.


#### Rhode Island's EV Adoption
In anticipation of mass electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the US, 
American Automobile Association (AAA) is teaming up with Ethos Hub to build 
predicative models to better plan EV charging infrastructure.


#### Mitigating Sound Pollution in Block Island's Wind Turbines
Offshore megawatt wind turbines are known to produce significant sound 
pollution. In this future project, we will focus on mitigating its adverse 
effects on marine mammals.
